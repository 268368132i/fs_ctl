This project is a proof of concept rather than a working solution.
The idea is to use FreeSwitch MCU for video conferences. Many organizations have video conferencing end-points with excellent PTZ cameras. FreeSwitch allows us to connect such devices as well as web users into video conferences. There is also an ability to stream and record video conferences.

There are two parts:
- **python**: communicates with FreeSwitch
- **web**: web interface.
A database server is used to link these two parts.

Please, see READMEs in subdirectories for details.
