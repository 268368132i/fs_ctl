# FS_CTL
This project is rather a proof of concept than a working solution.
The ideas is to use FreeSwitch MCU for video conferences. Many organizations have video conferencing end-points with excellent PTZ cameras. FreeSwitch allows us to connect such devices as well as users via WebRtc into video conferences. There is also an ability to stream and record video conferences.

This project consists of two parts:
- **python**: communicates with FreeSwitch
- **web**: web interface.
A database server is used to link these two parts.
